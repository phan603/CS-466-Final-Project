## Nussinov Sequence Backtrace and Visualization Running Instructions
### Installation:
Download the Nussinov_Sequence_Algorithm.py file from the repository homepage. Once downloaded, place the file into a folder stored wherever you like on your desktop, and run it in your code editor of choice (VSCode, Jupyter, Google Colab, etc.)
Once you have the Python file open in your code editor, install all the required modules used in the file. All imports are shown at the top of the Python file.


### Usage:
To run the program, scroll to line 182 of the Python file. There will be a comment that says, "Add your sequences here." Underneath, there will be 6 variables where you can input your desired RNA sequences as strings. To select your RNA sequence, you will need to edit lines 191, 204, and 206. In those lines, make sure to change the integer value inside "sequences" to match the index of the sequence you'd like to analyze.
Once you have edited all lines of code and selected your RNA sequence, simply run the code.
