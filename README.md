# Nussinov Sequence Backtrace and Visualization Running Instructions
### Installation:
Download the Nussinov_Sequence_Algorithm.py file from the repository homepage. Once downloaded, place the file into a folder stored wherever you like on your desktop, and run it in your code editor of choice (VSCode, Jupyter, etc.) If you are using Google Colab, then download the Nussinov_Sequence_Algorithm.ipynb, and import it into Google Colab.

Once you have the Python file open in your code editor, install all the required modules used in the file. All imports are shown at the top of the Python file. To install the modules, copy and paste this code into the Python file and run it. If you are using Google Colab, then there's no need to run the code below.
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install plotly
```

### Usage:
To run the program, scroll to line 182 of the Python file. There will be a comment that says, "Add your sequences here." Underneath, there will be 6 variables where you can input your desired RNA sequences as strings. 

To select your RNA sequence, you will need to edit lines 191, 204, and 206. In those lines, make sure to change the integer value inside "sequences" to match the index of the sequence you'd like to analyze.

Once you have edited all lines of code and selected your RNA sequence, simply run the code.

# Nussinov Algorithm Runtime and Space Complexity Running Instructions
### Installation:
Download the Nussinov_Sequence_Algorithm.ipynb file from the repository homepage. Once downloaded, place the file into a folder stored wherever you like on your desktop, and run it in your code editor of choice (VSCode, Jupyter, Google Colab, etc.)

Once you have the Python file open in your code editor, install all the required modules used in the file. All imports are shown at the top of the Python file. To install the modules, copy and paste this code into the Python file and run it. If you are using Google Colab, then there's no need to run the code below.
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

### Usage:
For this file, all you need to do is run the Python file, and the runtime analysis will be generated automatically. Since this file tests very long RNA sequences, expect this file to run for 24 hours.
